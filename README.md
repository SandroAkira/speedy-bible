============

Inspired by [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com) and [OpenSpritz](http://github.com/miserlou/openspritz), Speedy Bible applies the same approach to reading for the Bible.

A simple clean interface, Rapid Serial Visual Presentation of words, and [Go](http://www.golang.org) to make it even faster.

I welcome you to contribute!
